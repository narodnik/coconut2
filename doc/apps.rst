Potential Applications
**********************

Voting
======

The original Coconut paper lists a voting system as one of its main applications.

Distributed Filesystem
======================

Each credential contains user roles. To access files on the system, permissions are specified in terms of roles: :math:`Moderator \vee Administrator \vee Operator` 

Task Manager
------------

Manage your tasks in a group synchronizing with each other, without the need for a central server.

Decentralized Wiki
------------------

Utilizing the filesystem to share files which enable a collaborative decentralized wiki for documentation.

Anonymous Wallet
================

See DarkWallet project.

Uncensored Market
-----------------

See DarkMarket project.

DAO Token System
----------------

Also see ledger / double entry accounting. An accounting system where each asset is represented as a token, that enables the system to interoperate with other instances.

For example:

::

    Income:Work        -$25
    Assets:DarkCash     $25

I now have created DarkCash tokens which can be sent to other people and added into their own accounting system. They can also transfer these tokens to others as well.

# Crypto

1. Each input and output should have unique proofs, shortening the number of interactive protocol steps.
2. Use stealth-DH derivation to generate output key.
    1. Review Monero stealth scheme for possible scalability optimizations.
3. Replace rangeproofs with zk-snarks for possible speed improvement.
    1. Q: is this compatible with the existing pairing curve?
